## Project Summary

- Main app: `src/main.cc` builds the polygon workflow used by the stable release bundle.
- Demo app: `src/interview_main.cc` builds the guided interview/demo surface.
- Dev-only point-set app: `src/delaunay_driver.cc` drives Delaunay/Voronoi generation and the SVG viewer.
- Dev-only terrain app: `src/terrain_driver.cc` exposes the supported base TIN analysis through a versioned JSON contract.
- Build orchestration lives in `Makefile`; packaged outputs land in `dist/release/` and `dist/interview/`.

## Development Provenance

Coding-agent use first entered the repository in build tooling through PR #1. At `9f3ff67`, however—the last checkpoint before agent-authored C++ entered the tree—all 2,383 tracked C++ lines across 33 `.cc` and `.h` files were Harrison Wolf’s. Written from a Bash terminal using Vim and Make, that C++ foundation covered points, lines, triangles, polygons, collision and containment, an original ear-clipping triangulator, random polygon generation, CLI drivers, and early visualization support.

PR #2 then began the agent-authored C++ phase. Harrison later directed and reviewed coding-agent work that substantially revised the ear clipper and implemented the current Bowyer-Watson Delaunay and Voronoi layers, the custom TDD harness and much of its suite coverage, browser viewers, benchmark tooling, and terrain applications. The current repository is therefore mixed-authorship: a substantial hand-written C++ foundation followed by substantial agent-assisted expansion. The boundary is retained in the public history: `9f3ff67` records the last all-Harrison C++ checkpoint, while `728069f` explicitly records the Codex implementation of the Delaunay and Voronoi layers.

## Build And Run

- `make development-normal`: optimized dev build in `build/development/normal/`, including the development-only Delaunay, portfolio-export, benchmark, and terrain drivers.
- `make development-debug`: debug dev build in `build/development/debug/`; same executables, plus `DEBUG` logging support.
- `make release`: internal optimized build in `build/release/`; excludes development-only drivers.
- `make test-suite`: builds and runs 13 core geometry suites plus one independent terrain suite, then exercises the terrain JSON driver.
- `make release-bundle`: packages the stable polygon app into `dist/release/`.
- `make interview-release`: packages the interview/demo app into `dist/interview/` and seeds the Desmos exports.
- `make release-smoke`: rebuilds and validates the stable bundle.
- `make interview-smoke`: rebuilds and validates the interview bundle.
- `make benchmark-smoke`: creates and validates a new immutable benchmark evidence bundle.

Common run paths:

```bash
./build/development/normal/main
./build/development/normal/interview_demo
./build/development/normal/delaunay_driver
./build/development/normal/terrain_driver --format=json --units=metres < points.xyz
./dist/release/run.sh
./dist/interview/run-demo.sh
```
